# Vehicle-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
Predictive analytics project to classify vehicle insurance claim occurrence using machine learning.
# Vehicle Insurance Claim Prediction

## Project Overview
This project applies predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to predict whether a vehicle owner is likely to file an insurance claim. The objective is to support insurance risk assessment using data-driven methods.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Type: Vehicle Insurance Claim Dataset
- Target Variable: OUTCOME (0 = No Claim, 1 = Claim)

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model development:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Best Model
Random Forest Classifier was selected as the best model due to its robustness, generalization capability, and feature importance analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Project Structure
See repository folders for notebooks, dataset, report, and visualizations.

## Future Scope
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Advanced ensemble models
- Model deployment as a web application
